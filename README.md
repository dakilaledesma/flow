# flow

A cross-platform Flow/Pomodoro timer heavily inspired by the Flow (flowapp.info) app that is only available for macOS. Built using HTML/CSS, JavaScript on PyWebView/Python to handle window management.

Programmed in haste, needed a Pomodoro timer that I didn't have to install (due to work laptop restrictions) and was pleasing to look at.
